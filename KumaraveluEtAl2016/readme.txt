This is the readme for the matlab model associated with the paper:

Kumaravelu K, Brocker DT, Grill WM (2016) A biophysical model of the
cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus network in the 6-OHDA lesioned rat model
of Parkinson's disease. J Comput Neurosci 40:207-29

This model was contributed by K. Kumaravelu.

The model was run on the Duke Shared Cluster Resource with the
supplied q file.

20161212 Karthik Kumaravelu supplied a minor typo update where some
multiplicative forms (t_vec-t_d_...) were removed from bi-exponential
synaptic functions.
